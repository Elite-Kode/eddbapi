# EDDB API

Currently, [EDDB](https://eddb.io/) is the greatest treasure of information of the galaxy and it is a user friendly tool for many pilots. But it lacks an API for developers. EDDB API is an attempt to fill this gap by providing an API for EDDB data sources.

A great thanks to the developers of [EDDB](https://eddb.io/) without which this project would not have started. Special mention for the awesome group I am in, [Knights of Karma](http://knightsofkarma.com/), whose members had to put up with me making no contribution during development. And last but not least, [CMDR Blood Drunk](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/member.php/125031-Blood-Drunk), for making me MEAN and guiding me through all the troubles faced by me at all odd times!
